*The algorithms used in this tutorial are downscaled versions of an open-source Python altimetry package, currently being developed at JPL/Caltech: [captoolkit](https://github.com/fspaolo/captoolkit). This package provides a range of algorithms for common tasks in altimetry data processing. We also use the convenient data download interface from [icepyx](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx).
